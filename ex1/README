EX: 1

FILES:
osm.cpp -- implementation of the header file
osm.h -- header file supplied by course staff

REMARKS:
We used the function gettimeoftheday to get the time before and after performing the specified
operations - simple operation, function call and syscall.
We then converted the microseconds to nanoseconds and computed the average time it took to
perform the operation, that is diving by the number of iterations multiplied by the number of
the operations executed inside the for loop.

ANSWERS:

Q1: (Strace)
The program exits if the number of parameters sent to it was different than 1.
Else, if the program received only 1 parameter:
At first the program creates a directory with 775 permissions (grants read/write/execute
permission for user and group, and only read/execute permission for others) that is called
"Welcome".
Then it creates another directory inside "Welcome" called "To" with the same
permissions.
 Afterwards, the program creates a file called "OS2020" at the location
"Welcome/To" with writing permissions only, or if the file of that name in that location
already exists it will be automatically truncated to length 0.
 The program checks that the file was opened properly. Then it writes into that file:
 "(username) If you havent read the course guidelines yet, do it right now!".
 It then closes the file, removes the file "OS2020", the "To" directory and the "Welcome" directory.
