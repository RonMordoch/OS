REMARKS:
We implemented the hierarchical page table as described in the exercises.
For both reading and writing, we first translate the given virtual address into a physical address by traversing the
entire page table and then finding the frame that matches the conditions : first an empty frame, then an unused frame,
and then an evicted frame. We then take the processed address and perform the read/write operations on it.
